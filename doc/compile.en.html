Scenery generation process consists of following steps:

<ol>
<li>Create inf file for resample.exe.
<li>Execute resample.exe of Terrain SDK. Bitmap files and tmf files are created in this process.
<li>Merge alpha texture. In this process, textures and alpha textures are merged into 
targa (.tga) format bitmaps.
<li>Convert texture. In this process, targa format bitmaps are converted into 
BMP files used in Flight Simulator.
<li>Generate BGL file. Tmf files are compressed and BGL file is generated from the tmf file.
</ol>

Usually use "Run Whole Process".
<p>

That's all!!! All scenery files are generated.
