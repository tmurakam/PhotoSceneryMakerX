<h1>Prepare terrain photo bitmaps</h1>

Prepare terrain photo bitmaps. This process is most hard one.

<h2>Get the photo</h2>

First, get aerial or satellite photo bitmaps from any vendors then
scan the photo by scanners.
<p>

At least 4.8m/pixel resolution is needed.
<p>

<h2>Correct photo</h2>

If the whole photo scenery area is very huge, You must correct the photo.
<p>

To do this, get accurate topographical maps, overlaps the photo texture
over the maps with layer function of any graphic processing software like
Adobe Photo Shop, Paint Shop Pro etc.
<p>

Note: You must use "Unprojected Maps" as topographical maps:<p>

<p>

Unprojected maps include those that are formed by considering longitude and latitude
as a simple rectangular coordinate system.
Scale, distance, area, and shape are all distorted with the distortion
increasing toward the poles. 
<p>


<h2>Alpha (water-mask) bitmap</h2>

You need alpha bitmap to 'hollow out' the water area.
<p>
See sample bitmaps in Custom Terrain Textures SDK.
<p>

<h2>Bitmap format</h2>

Bitmaps format must be 24bit full-color BMP file.

<p>
If you want to use seasonal/lightmap photo scenery,
you need all 6 bitmaps of spring/summer/fall/winter/harsh winter/lightmap.
<p>

Optimal resolution of the bitmap is 4.8m/pixel (North-South),
and 6.4 * cos(latitude) m/pixel (East-West).
